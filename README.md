    their culinary experiences, and to engage in comments facilitating an interactive community where everyone can find a recipe that caters to their 
    taste.

  - ### Agile Methodology
    Agile methodology facilitated the prioritization and organization of tasks. It guided the writing of User Stories and the effective use of Project 
    Boards on Github.
    - Project Board is set to public.
    - Project Board was utilized to track User Stories in the "Todo", "In Progress" and "Done" columns.
    - Labels were added to indicate importance, such as "Must do".
