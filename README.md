## User Experience (UX)
### Engaging and Intuitive Interface:
Home Cooked Harmony offers a good user experience with a user-friendly interface.

### Personalized Recipe Discovery:
Users can search by number of servings, by preparation time or do a free search.

### Community Interaction:
Users can share their own recipes and comment culinary tips, enriching the overall blogging experience.

### Visual Appeal:
Users are encouraged to upload visually appealing images. When adding a post, users are prompted with clear instructions pased as "criteria" for uploading an organized post, this includes where to put the ingredients and measurements. Users have a rich text editor to customize their own formatting. If the website has many posts and comments, users will find it easy to navigate with organized pagination buttons. This ensures a visually informative browsing experience.

### Multi-Device Accessibility:
Optimized for all devices, the website ensures a smooth experience, whether users are planning their meals on a desktop or browsing recipes on a mobile device.

  - ### Project Goals
    The aim of my recipe blog project is to craft an engaging and user-friendly online space where gastronomy enthusiasts can discover and share          their experiences. Highlighting the diverse and rich world of cooking
    through visually appealing recipe displays and comprehensive, easy instructions. The project is designed to inspire users to create 
    their culinary experiences.

  - ### Agile Methodology
    Agile methodology facilitated the prioritization and organization of tasks. It guided the writing of User Stories and the effective use of            Project Boards on Github.
    - Project Board is set to public.
    - Project Board was utilized to track User Stories in the "Todo", "In Progress" and "Done" columns.
    - Labels were added to indicate importance, such as "Must do".
